Pure Rust implementation of a big integer library which has been designed from
the ground-up for use in cryptographic applications.

Provides constant-time, `no_std`-friendly implementations of modern formulas
using const generics.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## Goals

- Supports `no_std`-friendly const generic stack-allocated big integers.
- Constant-time by default. Variable-time functions are explicitly marked as such.
- Leverage what is possible today with const generics on `stable` rust.
- Support `const fn` as much as possible with the goal of being able to compute
  values at compile-time.
- Optional heap-allocated `Boxed*` types gated under an `alloc` feature.

## Security Notes

This crate has been [audited by NCC Group] with no significant
findings. We would like to thank [Entropy] for funding the audit.

All functions contained in the crate are designed to execute in constant
time unless explicitly specified otherwise (via a `*_vartime` name suffix).

This library is not suitable for use on processors with a variable-time
multiplication operation (e.g. short circuit on multiply-by-zero /
multiply-by-one, such as certain 32-bit PowerPC CPUs and some non-ARM
microcontrollers).
